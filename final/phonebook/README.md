## Running

```bash
$> make
$> ./main
```

## Problem description

Menu-driven phonebook. Searchable by name, address, phone number.

## Implementation

Entries are stored in `record` objects. All fields are stored as strings.

`record`s are refereneced by a `std::map` mapping each name, address, and phone
number to an individual record (stored on the heap).

Lookup/access is O(log n) time for `map`s, so while this implementation may not 
be spatially conservative, lookup is relatively fast.

I believe my implementation could be called a naive database implementation.

The data file `phonebook` was pseudo randomly generated by mostly spamming the
home row.  For simplicity, only one "name" is included per record.  Matching is
case- and whitespace-sensitive. I have included a record with my own name and 
human-readable address.
