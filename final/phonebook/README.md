# CS 361 - Final Exam, Part B, Question 1

This is my submission for "best" solution.

## Running

```bash
$> make
$> ./main
```

## Problem description

Menu-driven phonebook. Searchable by name, address, phone number.

## Implementation

Entries are stored in `record` objects. All fields are stored as strings.

`record`s are refereneced by a `std::map` mapping each name, address, and phone
number to an pointer to a record declared on the heap.

The `<map>` STL implements a `find` function in O(log n).  By using keys which
map to `record` pointers, I've eliminated the need to duplicate storage in memory.

I believe my implementation could be called a naive database implementation.

The data file `phonebook` was pseudo randomly generated by mostly spamming the
home row.  For simplicity, only one "name" is included per record.  Matching is
case- and whitespace-sensitive. I have included a record with my own name and 
human-readable address.

## Tests

To build and run tests, comment out `line 55` of the Makefile (`TARGET=main`).
Then run the following commands.

```bash
$> make TARGET=<name of test file without extension>
$> ./<name of test file without extension>

# example

$> make TARGET=recordTest
touch record.d
cat record.d > make.dep
g++ -g -std=c++11 -Wall -MMD -c record.cpp
g++ -g -std=c++11 -Wall  -o recordTest recordTest.cpp record.o -lm
$> ./recordTest
