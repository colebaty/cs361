## Problem description

Menu-driven phonebook. Searchable by name, address, phone number.

## Implementation

Entries are stored in `record` objects. All fields are stored as strings.

`record`s are refereneced by a `std::map` mapping each name, address, and phone
number to an pointer to a record declared on the heap.

The `<map>` STL implements a `find` function in O(log n).  By using keys which
map to `record` pointers, I've eliminated the need to duplicate storage in memory.

I believe my implementation could be called a naive database implementation.

The data file `phonebook` was pseudo randomly generated by mostly spamming the
home row.  For simplicity, only one "name" is included per record.  Matching is
case- and whitespace-sensitive. I have included a record with my own name and 
human-readable address.
